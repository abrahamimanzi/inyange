                                        <b>Milk</b> is one of the healthiest groceries around but also a slightly demanding one. All Inyange industries products are treated gently with ultra-high temperature. That means that germs have been eliminated before the products are packed. The UHT treatment also enables a long storage of dairy products without refrigeration. However, once the packaging is open, the air can transmit germs into the product which accelerate its durability. This means that the products cannot be stored ambient anymore but need cooling between 4-8Â°C. Once opened a dairy product needs to be consumed within 3-4 days.
